You can determine which grade is better or worse, but you can't say how much better an A is than a B. Attempting to calculate a mean grade (e.g., (A + B + B) / 3) doesn't make sense in this context.\n",

    "In contrast, if you have a dataset of students' heights in centimeters, which is at the ratio level, you can perform arithmetic operations, calculate means, and meaningfully say that a student who is 180 cm is 10 cm taller than a student who is 170 cm.\n",

    "Q.10 Common measures of central tendency and variability used in statistics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "1. Mean: The arithmetic average of a dataset. It provides a measure of the \"typical\" value.\n",
    "   - Use: Describes the center of the data and is often used for normally distributed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Median: The middle value in a sorted dataset, separating it into two equal halves. It's not affected by extreme values.\n",
    "   - Use: Useful when dealing with skewed data or datasets with outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mode: The most frequently occurring value(s) in a dataset.\n",
    "   - Use: Identifies the most common value(s) in categorical or discrete data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Variability (Dispersion):\n",
    "1. Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.\n",
    "   - Use: Provides a simple measure of the spread of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variance: The average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean. It quantifies the overall variability.\n",
    "   - Use: Gives a more precise measure of how data points deviate from the mean, but it's in squared units.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance. It provides a measure of variability in the original units of the data.\n",
    "   - Use: Offers a more interpretable measure of data spread compared to variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Interquartile Range (IQR): The range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) of the dataset. It's less sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "   - Use: Describes the middle 50% of data and helps identify the spread around the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "These measures help summarize and describe datasets:\n",
    "- Measures of central tendency provide information about where the \"center\" of the data is located.\n",
    "- Measures of variability quantify how spread out or dispersed the data points are.\n",
    "- Together, they give a comprehensive view of a dataset's distribution and characteristics, helping in data analysis and interpretation."
